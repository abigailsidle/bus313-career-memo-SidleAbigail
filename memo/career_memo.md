# Career Reflection Memo

## Introduction
My name is Abigail Sidle, a junior pursuing a Business Management major. Some of my interests are reading, playing video games, and skateboarding. In this memo, I intend to reflect on my career journey thus far and discuss my current goals for my future trajectory.

## Career Objectives
Beginning mid-September 2022, I was hired as a curbie for HEB (a grocery store in Texas). It was a lowest level job in the curbside department. The company required employees under 18, which I was at the time, to work at the lower positions (curbie, bagger, cart retreival, etc). for a minimum of 3 months before being promoted. I was promoted to in-store shopper as soon as my 3 months had elapsed. I worked as a shopper for 3 more months before being promoted to specialist (part-time management) in March. The location I worked had a total of 80-110 personnel that I got to know. During one shift, I could be managing, delegating, training, and over-seeing anywhere from 30-50 employees. I worked in this management position for 7 months before starting my education at UH Manoa at the end of August 2023.

When I returned for winter and summer breaks, I returned to the specialist position in a seasonal capacity. During these periodic intermissions in my education, my primary manager would update me on the company, our location, our department performance, and the many changes in personnel. During these conversations, we would examine the time slot service graph for the day to ensure our department would not be overwhelmed by volume, analyzed and executed different future projections for our units, volume, and sales, and apply those projections to the schedule manager.
